**A Dialectical Discourse in African and Western notions of Ontology and Aesthetics**

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Written by: Kristian Francis**

In the quest of coherence and clarity it is the aims of this paper to address the apparent dichotomy between the types of thought regarding the issues of Ontology and Aesthetics within two influential spheres of belief. The interest in this area lies in the historical neglect of fair philosophical discourse regarding culture, and the uses of it to consolidate a specific social and ethical status quo.

It is necessary to clarify the main points that will be addressed at further length within this paper:

-Dialectic, is merely an expression of the dualistic nature of the proposed title, particularly as it hopes to explore two seemingly distinct cultural and conceptual philosophical issues.

-Ontology/The Nature of Being, these terms will be used with reference to a distinction drawn between the selected Western academic's pursuits in the field, and it's expressions in African Philosophy.

-Aesthetics/ The Nature of Art, these terms will serve the purpose of denoting in the former the prevalent Western form, whilst the latter will provide a distinction with reference to the metaphysical assumptions held within African Philosophy.

-African Philosophy is framed so as denote the reflective and contemplative activities of African people. As such, it will be viewed In terms of 'traditional religion', which incorporates the two former concepts within culture. The 'other' view will be that of the post-colonial African scholar, for whom:

'...the closing years of the twentieth century are bound to be for Africa and Africans a time of prolonged, and deep reflection and self-examination.'.

(African Philosophy, Tsenay Serequeberhan, p9)

This_post-colonial_ 'reflection' and 'self-examination' will be couched in terms of literature or 'art as celebration' with regards to contemporary African thinkers, especially Chinua Achebe, Frantz Fanon, Leopold Senghor, etc.

  
_Chapter 1_

**Ontology**

Indeed, 'philosophy is essentially a reflective activity...' (African Philosophy, Blackwell Books), and since the genesis of Ancient Greek philosophy it has posed questions and sought answers about the essence of (human) existence. This pursuit has not slowed down with the onset of time, in fact it has taken various directions, it might be helpful at this time to trace some of the more dominant and applicable views concerned:

**Ontology**. 1\. The branch of metaphysical inquiry concerned with the study of existence itself (considered apart from the nature of any existent object... 2\. The assumptions about existence underlying any conceptual scheme or any theory or system of ideas.

(A Dictionary of Philosophy, Macmillan Press)

  
Parmenides of Elea, around 6th B.C, was probably the first early Greek philosopher to address metaphysical questions regarding, 'The Way of Truth', consisting in a priori arguments about the nature of being.

Parmenides was insistent that 'you could not know that which is not (for that is impossible), nor could you speak of it' (2.7-8) from this principle he leads on to the conclusions that any object that can be investigated has to exist (7.2). This is not to mean that it is merely illogical to investigate something non-existent, but the more far reaching claim that if an object is to be investigated then it exists under all possible circumstances. For as he expresses elsewhere, 'what is there to be said and thought has to be' (6.1). (quotes extracted From, Oxford Illustrated History of Western Philosophy)

An interpretation of these obscure and contentious views may mean that merely a possible failure to exist at some time can no more be thought or spoken of than something that actually does not.

'Furthermore, a failure to exist at some time can no more be thought or spoken of than a failure to exist under some possible circumstances.' (Language, Thought and Falsehood in Ancient Greek Philosophy)

Many people found Parmenides ideas confounding and paradoxical, the idea of thinking and speaking of that which is not. 'Of course many people understandably reacted to Parmenides arguments with derision (Plato, _parmenides_ 128 d1). It is a pluralistic end to which Parmenides appears to be heading, what he seems to offer is in essence a justification for a type of conceptual determinism, grounded on the presumptions of the notion of ontology.

The gap between Appearance and hypothesized Reality preoccupied much of philosophical speculation in the ancient world, but Parmienides' contribution was a powerfully persuasive and profound ontological supposition: that there could be neither void, nor change, nor difference, The Way of Truth requires us to think that being Is, and never could be otherwise. 'If we _can_ know truth -- as Parmenides said we could -- it could not be on the basis of sensory appearance. Reason alone dictates what Is. The truth open only to the divine intellect is what the intellect declares it to be: there can be no division between Being and Thought. This for Parmenides is the One \[or the Oneness of the All\].' (Oxford Illustrated History of Western Philosophy, Oxford University Press)

N.B.-It might be of use to note that Parmenides presented his ideas within his works as 'Inspiration's, it has been likened to the revelations of Hebrew teachers and prophets. For, to think as the poets and philosophers did -- that **Nothing** proceeded **Everything**, means there was, and is, no **Nothing. **There is Something that must be, which is the only Truth we grope to express in all our utterances. Additionally, according to Parmenides any little truth is 'true' only by convention, because we agree to count it so, and thus it is neither contingent, nor incomplete, nor divided into little truths. There is an acknowledgment inherent in Parmenide's reasoning that _our_ Realities are the inalterable consequence of Being, and as such cannot be divorced from our immediate experiences, and the conventions of 'truth'. Despite this he still posits the value of 'divine intellect', which is in essence a recognition of the 'oneness' of All.

It seems proper to introduce a revealing distinction between Pre-Socratic philosophers, and Post-Socratic philosophers. Based on the type of questions they asked and how they came to explain and understand the conclusions they reached, it is an assertion inherent and thus relevant to the conclusion that the type of reflection is much closer to the mode of African Philosophy. The reasons for this bold supposition are partly based on semi-historical records (i.e. Herodotus, Manetho), and partly due to distortion, misunderstanding, and the historically inward-looking intellectual activities of the Western tradition.

  
The basis for these claims are to be posed as the symptomatic problems which have beset the rigor of academic theory, the ideological conflicts manifest as such : _duality, the marginalisation of academic disciplines into sub-disciplines, and the new religion of Science, attitudes to nature, to power, Descartes legacy of the Ego at the_ _center of Man's cognitive existence, and its role in relation to I-Other Ontology, and Aesthetics\]_

  
For the sake of chronological and conceptual continuity one would like to move on, to perhaps one the most enduring and influential of the early Greek philosophers, namely Plato:

  
'Within this natural attitude, the body can be considered in its most simple form as a purely physical entity. As physical, the body possesses mass occupies space and its matter is converted into energy. Mass is the constant we know relatively as weight, which, like the space the body occupies, can achieve enormous and unhealthy proportions. The function of the mind is to keep this from occurring; of themselves, bodies can only continue to occupy space, each part related to every other part contiguously and co-extensively. Like stones, chairs and tables, and marble statues, the human body has contour, is bounded in a shape that cuts its figure into 'objective' space \[perceptible, accessible, public, the Other!\], the three dimensional container of all physical existents; and like stones, chairs, and the like, the human body, if it were nothing but physical, could not move unless it were moved by another thing. Plato was so struck with this last thought that he used it to establish both the existence and immortality of the soul. After all, the human body does move, and not necessarily by the action of another thing, so it is self-moving. What is self-moving must be eternal; so the soul will never die, even when it has left the body and given it over to rot.'

This quote serves the following purposes, firstly it outlines the basic premise of Plato's theory of the immortality of the Soul, it also serves as a basis for considering further elucidation's upon the same theme in Western philosophy, namely, _existence_ and _being._

It is of relevance to later observations on the nature of religion, with reference to our notions of Ontology and Art, that Plato's theory become embedded in Judeo-Christian Theology/Theosophy, and indeed mainstream consciousness. The significance of this observation is for further thought regarding the Idea of 'Religion' between 'Traditional African Religion' on the one hand, and 'religion' in the contemporary West.

  
Rene Descartes (1596-1650), the French philosopher and mathematician' huge influence on subsequent thinkers, and theories alike, is still a recognizable legacy. In 1641 he published his most notable masterpiece, Meditationes de Prima Philosophia (Meditations), the definitive issues raised are, firstly it is intensely individualistic and is written in the first person like, Discourse, before it. The title alone conveys the character of this voyage from _'doubt'_ to _'certainty'_, it is presented as a private mental exercise which the reader must 'make his own'. It is the _ego/_I in his famous dictum, 'ergo cogito sum...' (I think, therefore I am) which forms the__starting point for his articulations on the metaphysical constitution of man. This is significant in that it also mirrors a turning point in Western thinking and culture, in terms of the rise and influence of an individualistic world-view which penetrated a diverse range of activities most notably the arts and sciences. For example, the emergent expression and popularity of the first person narrated novel, the momentum of the legitimacy of science becoming embedded in Western thought, and the changing intellectual climate which encouraged the onset of the _Age of Reason)._

The second distinctive feature of Descartes' _Meditation_s is his attempt, albeit misguided, to start afresh in his discourse, free from the preconceptions which have dogged much theory (unfortunately the apparently misconceptions eluded him). This view is deemed misguided simply because it misses the point, he posited a way, via science, of effectively coping with the world in giving:

'...objective, accurate, value-free copies of the world'

(Philosophy, Politics, and Power: An Afro American Perspective, , African Philosophy, An Anthology, Blackwell Books)

The consequences of this self-absorbed and solipsistic philosophy will become clearer as we move further into more contemporary work on Ontology, and _truth_ and _value._

1. It is part of the overall theme of this paper that in particular the notion of a value-free judgment, method, philosophy, or artistic expression are naive and insular beliefs:

The device Descartes relies on to produce an effective starting point for philosophy is his famous method of 'doubt'. It was by his insistence that the first task of the philosopher to rid oneself of all prejudice by calling into doubt all that can be doubted (except for the all important subjective and value-laden signifier, "I"). He begins by observing the fallibility of the senses to be deceived, and concludes that 'it is prudent not to trust entirely anything that has once deceived us'. This argument is both well documented and consistent with his general assertions, and yet for Descartes there is a point at which there is not much more philosophical 'doubting' may be done. This is as result of his positing an existential truth amongst his dictum, being, "I" exist, but this supposed _truth_ is not subject to the rigorous method of doubt, and thus it follows that one can only be as certain of something as one's own existence. Descartes notions support the view that we have access to, a priori, arrive at, and acquire knowledge of the world through the autonomous individual. Once again, due to the subject matter relevant to later chapters it is important to bear in mind that the primacy of the individual, subject, or ego who accurately 'copies' the world or validly makes inferences about the world serves as a foundation for the philosophical basis for modern science.

  
The next addition to this brief summary of key theories in the area of Ontology in Western philosophy is Edmund Husserl (1859-1938). Husserl, in his publication Logical Investigations (1913-1921), put forward the idea of a pure \[ontological\] theory of objects or formal ontology. This involved dealing with formal and specific _**categories**_; object, state-of-affair, series, number, relation \[a rigorously mechanistic ambition\]. His work on these disciplines would be seen to compliment progress being made in formal logic. Formal logic was meant to address the forms of the _object _domains to which scientific theories correspond, however the partnership of formal ontology and formal logic was usurped by the emergence of 'set theories and substituted mathematical artifacts' (Blackwell companion to Metaphysics). However, on closer inspection they bear little or no relation to the flesh and blood subject matters of scientific theory, a charge which will be invoked at a later stage.

It was Husserl's determination (not too dissimilar to Descartes) that no study of the mind could proceed until mental phenomena had been separated from residual beliefs about the physical world. His views were expressed most predominantly in, _Ideas (1913)_, and _Cartesian Meditations_ (1929), they also signaled an active movement in philosophy being awakened, phenomenology:

'To this end we must embark on a 'phenomenological reduction', canceling or 'bracketing' the reference to external things, so as to confront the pure phenomenon. In studying my fear of spiders, as it inwardly appears, I bracket the reference to spiders, and study only the spider-wards intentionality that points towards them. I then bracket the scientific _concept _of spider, using instead the notion of spider as it appears: threatening, alien, 'unheimlich'. Eventually, Husserl thinks, I arrive at what is purely '**given'** in consciousness, the phenomenon as it is in itself. The phenomenological reduction now becomes an 'eidetic' reduction or 'ideation', as we plot the limits within which a thing can be imagined to vary without ceasing to be the thing it is. This process leads at last to an Idea or essence -- the 'horizon of potentiality' which is grasped when all contamination of the actual has been thought away.'

It is the ontological consequences of this view, which intrigue me, for as an object of my own awareness I am merely an 'empirical self' or a component of the contingent world. Yet, the negative implications of this theory is its strong egological basis, the reductionism of the 'other'/'object', for the 'transcendental ego' which exists only as subject and never as object is an active agent in the world. The onus of an objective sanitized science, or philosophical method eluded Husserl as it had Descartes, he attempted to overcome the subjective emphasis of phenomenology by means of a theory of Social reality, which will lead us neatly to the works of Martin Hediegger and Jean-Paul Sartre.

It is on the crucial distinction between "I", "We", "They", "Them", or in short the "I-Other" debate. In Posthumously published piece Husserl deliberately shifts his grammar from the 'transcendental I', to 'We' he believed we reach the transcendental 'We' by an imaginative self-projection. It is the scope of this paper to outline these views and consider them in relation to an African conception of both Ontology and Aesthetics: yet it is possible to observe the lack of room in the western tradition to accommodate conceptual pluralism. It follows that projections of culturally subjective views become universalized ontological truths to account for the common-sense world of a community of language users.

('The Other', Michael Thunissen, XIV)

'Equally startling and perhaps even provocative is his thesis regarding the derivative status of the alter ego and the final coincidence of the Other with my 'ego' (in particular with my past ego). Transcendental empathy, Husserl writes:

'Does not presuppose the alter ego, but posits it first of all.'

Just as in mediating the Other's concrete existence, 'my body...plays the role of the originary body' (_Urlieb_), so my I, as the mediator all alien I-ness, takes on the meaning of an 'originary norm' (_Urnorm_)

In this way, however, the Other becomes an 'analogue' of my own, Husserl tends to go beyond the representation of analogy and mirroring in the direction of identity. Attention must be made to the individualistic viewpoint of his discourse, in particular its reliance on the unbiased nature of the subject's rationality and freedom from dogma and prejudice (which it is obviously not free from). From the standpoint from experience, the I of the Other is my own I. These considerations undergird the author's views on solipsism. In rejecting the 'equiprimordiality' of the Other, Husserl reveals the 'undeniable limitations' of his attempt 'to overcome...the transcendental solipsism' of pure 'egology through the _**theory of inter-subjectivity'**_ (Italics and bold mine).

According to Thunissen, the 'limitations' are most clearly evident in the emphasis on the _indirect_ or _mediated _character of interpersonal contact'. 'This is the most significant of all the points in common,' he writes, 'That in \[Husserl's\] _theory of inter-subjectivity_ and \[Heidegger's\] analysis of 'being-with, the immediacy of the encounter with the Other is discounted in a similar manner because the medium of the 'world's interposed between 'me' and 'others'. Husserl's theory is conveniently labeled 'constitutive egology' by Thunissen, he then introduces an elucidation on Husserl's theory by Jean-Paul Sartre:

'The chief innovation in Sartre's approach, according to Der Andere, resides in his partial endorsement of inter-subjective immediacy, in the sense of a direct impact of the Other on 'my' experience. As delineated in the dialectic of the look.'

The Other usually approaches me as an alien reality or an 'extra- mundane existence completely immune from the grasp of phenomenological reduction'. Thunissen notes, 'the primarily present Other is, according to Sartre, supposed to be a 'real being existing beyond this \[my\] world'. That is an entity that does not first achieve its fullness of being for me out of its \[socially ontological\] world relation', and thus imposes itself as an 'immediate presence'.

To an extent it might be assumed that mediation plays a role, or operates in a reverse manner to that of Husserl's model: instead of being a medium of 'my' world, the Other in the end 'mediates me with myself'.

Thus Husserl rejects the passivity of the I-Other relation, and seeks to contain/mediate (neutralize/tame?), and thus project, create and interpret according to 'my' culturally specific and personalized conception of social ontology \[ethics and values of Being\], surely this is a one-sided process.

Sartre's view is most relevant as it directly posits the power or 'immediacy' of the Others reality, this view shall be reverted to in discussion about Kant's and Burke's theories of the Sublime and Beauty. The purpose of this emphasis on the perception and projection of subjective values on an Other existence is that it has not until recently in Western philosophy been recognized. It is as a result of not recognizing a problem with the pursuit of objectivity that we have overlooked the arrogant and prejudiced ways in which we often view the world, and Others. It appears that in Husserl's theories he hoped to establish a rational basis for transcendental empathy having some universal currency of meaning.

In the following chapters, in particular regarding art and aesthetics, it will be asserted that traditional judgments in these areas too are also not value-free, nor culturally unbiased. There is throughout this paper an underlying proposition; that the relationship between _Art _and _Existence_ has manifested itself in a diverse range of cultures over history, and that these manifestations are culturally specific due to a plethora of reasons. It is the job of a philosopher in any of these regions to determine the questions of philosophical importance, with regard to an inquiry of Western and African concepts of ontology and aesthetics; the 'I-Other' study is particularly insightful, as one hopes to show.

An example of the purpose to which one would like to apply ontological theory is to be found in, 'Influence in Art and Literature' (Ontological Principles):

'However, a study of the work of his 'Negroid' period shows that Picasso was influenced as much by the general characteristics of Negro sculpture as by the peculiarities of the individual pieces he owned or saw.'

'Again, as in _Les Demoiselles_, the influence of African Negro art is evident.

In all these examples, two entities are related to each other, and one of them is said to have influenced the other. To facilitate generalizations and to save space, I shall use X and Y as variables for these entities. Thus, the examples above can be compressed into the following brief formula "X influenced Y"

However, a variable is entered into the formula, but an interest in this formulation remains because ontological principles are culturally specific values, like aesthetic forms and value.

'However, an artist is not influenced by the works of another artist in general but in a particular respect, such as technique, style, expression, symbolism, and so forth. I shall therefore regard influence as a three-way relation; "X influenced Y" is an abbreviation of "X influenced Y with respect to A".'

In this example "A" is taken to denote a culturally specific ontological and/or aesthetic principle, the consequences of such a view will be tackled in more depth in the next chapter. The idea that some type of metaphysical assumptions accompany or enhance one's understanding of the Art of a Particular Milieu is a persistent belief which shall be illustrated through the work of Heidegger;

  
With close reference to a paper published by Daniel.E.Palmer, called 'Heidegger and the Ontological significance of a piece of Art', and would like to turn all attention to the penetrating thought Martin Heidegger (1889-1976).

"In the epilogue to 'The Origin of The Work of Art' Heidegger himself affirms that the proceeding 'reflections are concerned with the riddle of art, the riddle that art itself is. They are far from claiming to solve that riddle." (OWA 79)

One might wonder why such a prominent and learned academic intellectual is 'riddled' by questions of _art, _since indeed__aesthetics has been a independent discipline for approximately one hundred years. The 'they' in question is taken to represent the philosophical community, and it is Heidegger's distinct departure or separation from the standard or accepted views that his work stands out as we shall see.

Daniel.E.Palmer tries to show, "That Heidegger's reflections upon art do not belong within the province of aesthetics or the philosophy of art." and does so convincingly. His ideological rift from mentor, Edward Husserl represents a separation and progression for Heidegger.

'Rather, they \[his theories\] must be understood in terms of Heidegger's rejection of both the traditional division of philosophy into unique domains of research, and more poignantly, the _**aesthetic approach to art.'**_

Palmer's paper follows a 'negative appraisal' of the typical philosophical assessment of a piece of art -- to his own positive evaluation of art and it's 'philosophical and cultural significance'. He begins by stating that Heidegger's 'entire philosophical oeuvre is unified by the centrality of the _**Seinsfrage**_, the question of the meaning of Being that Heidegger always took to be the central question of philosophy'. It might be relevant to draw a rough comparison between this and the philosophies of Neiztsche with regards to the relation of _art, power, and being_.

Being and Time, Heidegger's powerful critique of the philosophical tradition, he asserts \[that Being is\]: 'that which determines entities as entities' (Being and Time, p. 25).

'And this, Heidegger discovered, consists in the intelligibility embodied in shared social and historical practices that allow various sorts of entities (tools, persons, institutions, numbers, etc.) to show up as significant for us in our everyday comportment.'

The importance and ramifications of this statement are huge, in that he is depart from a widely accepted philosophical position, being that isolated and insular studies of cause and effect, or objects/phenomena- in -themselves are fruitless and misguided. This point relates well to the later discussion of the aesthetic judgments of Immanuel Kant and Edmund Burke, as we shall observe later. 'Heidegger's investigations into any particular type of entity, whether it be artwork or a cultural artifact, are always carried out in relation to the _**Seinsfrage **_and the original source of disclosure. As such, from early on in his career \[we are told\] Heidegger rejected the usual partitioning of philosophy into distinct sub-disciplines.'

From the beginning to the end, Heidegger's thought orbited around the one question of being, thus, while interpreting his works on art the bigger issue of being is omnipresent. It is in his characteristically dogged insistence on the potential of art to reflect the answers to his questions of art and being, that ensure its relevance to this paper.

For, \[he\] 'deliberately yet tacitly moves on the path of the question of Being. Reflection on what art may be is completely and decidedly determined only in regard to the question of Being.'

(The Origin of the Work of Art, p.86)

As a consequence of Heidegger's rejection of the traditional method of aesthetic investigation, his work on art was closely tied to his critique of western Metaphysics:

'Indeed, in "The Age of The World Picture" he lists the events of art's moving into the purview of aesthetics.'

This is taken to be a direct reference to the emergence of an extreme subjectivist modern world-view, and seen with regards to the perceptions and values of 'other' cultures such a 'World Picture' appears unarguably destructive. It is not an over-dramatization to frame such a view in imperial/neo-colonial terms, for the consequences indicate such a mentality, and perhaps its aims.

According to Palmer's critique and reading, 'Heidegger claims that since almost from its inception the western interpretation of beings has been dominated by a '_**substance ontology**_'. That is, entities or things are to be taken to be self-subsisting and independently that stand over and above detached, observing subjects. As building blocks of the universe, substances are interpreted as the only things that exist in their own right and all other phenomena are interpreted in terms of their causal interaction. // Heidegger points out in 'The Age of the World Picture', this extreme objectivism that founds the ancient and medieval experience of being sets the necessary stage \[for a Hegelian style historic process of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis\] for the subjectivism that marks the modern era. For at the threshold of modernity Descartes merely accepted that reality must be conceived primarily in terms of independently existing substances which are only causally related, and took the natural step in asserting that if this is so, then we can be assured of the real nature of such substances or things-in-themselves as we only have access to their causal effects (sensory experiences) upon us. Only our own perceptions, the effects that said objects have on our faculties, are immune from doubt. The ancient supposition that entities are to be viewed with detachment as independently subsisting objects corresponds essentially with the modern claim \[of the sciences especially\] that only our subjective experiences are indubitable and thus the only secure region for philosophic inquiry.'

This is interesting when seen in post-Wittgensteinian terms of the 'private language argument', which occupied much of western analytic philosophy since and its legacy. Especially when one refers to the non-sensical nature of a _private _language and its capacity to have meaning being generated by _activity_ and _use_ primarily. The relevance of this to _belief _is that, apparently, subjectivity offers 'the only secure region' of philosophic activity, despite Wittgenstein's emphasis on the social facets of meaning, and its _language-game_ specific orientation.

Heidegger's affirms the relation of existence to environment, or 'world':

'World is never an object that stands before us and can be seen. World is the ever non-objective \[of 'my' perception perhaps\] to which we are subject as long as the paths of birth and death, blessing and curse keep us transported into Being.'

It might be helpful to visualize this as a homogenous experience, whereby 'my' world and activities are held together by the glue of 'social ontology', for:

'The world is not an object, but in the context of involvement that allows entities to appear as significant for us in various ways, just as being involved in business practices provides a holistic background context in which various kinds of things come to light as significant for the business person.'

'In revealing entities throughout involvement in one set of historical and cultural practices, we also close off other possibilities for encountering entities, just as by analogy being involved in the world of business allows the business person access to things in one way, say as potentially profitable, while closing off other ways of seeing them, say as having spiritual value.'

These points will be particularly useful with regard to the discourse on aesthetics as this stinging criticism resounds amongst the many sub-disciplines of scientific inquiry, and should enhance awareness of the _autonomous _status of many fields of study. It also bodes well for the following study of African concepts of art, religion, and ritual, to which the reflection of our 'world' is crucial.

As Heidegger puts in '\*The Origin of the Work of Art':

'thanks to this clearing \[opened by a world\], beings are unconcealed in certain degrees. And yet being can be concealed, to, only within the sphere of what is lighted. Each being we encounter and which encounters us keeps to this curious opposition of presence in that it always withholds itself at the same time in concealedness.' (\*OWA 53)

An allusion to the 'extreme subjectivism' which in the circumstance of an encounter with another upholds 'this curious opposition of presence', or I-Other immediacy mentioned earlier.

It has been an underlying aim to convey the ways in which Heidegger thought that art might disclose 'world', one might suspect in the example of a painting that this is through representation that art achieves this. Heidegger clearly denies that it is only representational works of art which work in this disclosive manner, citing the example of a Greek temple. How the work of art works to bring forth the world and earth in their reciprocal conditioning:

'...the building encloses the figure of the god...and gathers around itself the unity of those paths and relations in which birth and death, disaster and blessing, victory and disgrace, endurance and decline acquire the shape of destiny for human being.' (\*OWA 41-42)

This example may also be appropriately applied to the many cultures whose art is conceived in terms of forms rather than pictorial representation, maybe the mobilization of thousands of people for millennia in constructing ancient 'primitive' structures (from pyramids to monoliths and elaborate burial chambers).

'a cultural paradigm \[that\] collects the scattered pieces of a group, unifies them into coherent possibilities for action, and holds them up to the people who can then act and relate to each other in terms of that exemplar.'

This is not an a-historical or 'primitive' concept of unification of world, earth, intention, and being for, 'Even the contemporary works such as Warhol's reproductions of commercial products can be seen in terms of their ability to display in a concrete manner the world in which the modern industrial consumer dwells, and the sense bestowed upon entities in that world.

Daniel Palmer makes a subtle but important point about how we should accept the concept of art as, 'Unlike scientific cognition that attempts to determine completely the object, great works of art do not try to master completely their material. Rather, they let the material shine forth in all its mystery as that which resists being subsumed under our rationalisations \[this point is a significant area in Burke's theory of the Sublime\]. Indeed, the reason that great works are open to endless interpretation is that they carry within them this aspect; they refuse to yield fully to our intent.'

It is this incisive issue of domination and assertion that dogs western metaphysics, because the path of rationalisation does not allow for inconsistency, nor incomprehensibility. The significance of the Western paradox highlights the impetus from within to purge thought of 'meaningless', incoherent, and too often unfortunately 'Other' uncomplimentary thought systems. In the modern industrial western world the conflict between tradition and modernity increases a chasm between worlds of perception and value, Heidegger writes in 'The Question Concerning Technology';

'Since destining at any given time starts man on a way of revealing, man, thus underway, is continually approaching the brink of the possibility of pursuing and pushing forward nothing but what is revealed in ordering, and deriving all of his standards on that basis...Where this ordering holds sway, it drives out every possibility of revealing...Where Enframing holds sway, regulating and securing of the standing-reserve mark all revealing. They no longer even let their own fundamental characteristic appear, namely, this revealing as such.' (QCT 26,27)

Palmer's discerning and insightful critique raise one last vital reservation, which he phrases as such;

'...because the technological understanding of Being has gained such an all-pervasive hold, across all cultures and sectors of human affairs, there is the possibility that we will be so swept away in this single manner of revealing as to cut off for good the possibility of future ways of revealing. Second, there is the danger that in our absorption in the practices that embody this mode of concealing we will completely cover over its character of revealing.'

  
It is now deemed appropriate in the next part of this inquiry to address the academic endeavours to identify a universal transcendental aesthetic principle of value. The danger indicated above by Palmer's statement is closer to fruition in this realm than perhaps others, as the 'world' inhabited by the theorists is distantly removed from the rest of the developing world, or lay-people of the industrial world. As a result the 'concealedness' of aesthetic principles theories is granted, and the means of 'revealing' are presumed to be inclusive and incontestable. We need to balance this ordering and revealing in the hope of broadening of our conceptual horizons; this should start with an acknowledgment of the subjectivity and fallibility of such philosophical positions.

_Chapter 3_

Aesthetics:

  
Primarily, the usefulness of an investigation into differing views of aesthetics will highlight the types assumptions which are inherent in our everyday thought about Art and it's essence. The significant issues that shall be followed with enthusiasm are the 'stereotypes', distortions and ideologically driven motive behind many of the formally proposed and accepted theories. The previous discussion of Heidegger will in effect contrast the following pervasive Western principles for aesthetic inquiry:

First of all we shall consult a paper written by Meg Armstrong called;

"The Effects of Blackness": Gender, Race, and the Sublime in Aesthetic Theories of Burke and Kant.

(The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 54:3 Summer 1996)

It starts with three quotes about aesthetic representation, and thus stereotypes:

'stereotypes, however, are one form of representation. Like fictions, they are created to serve as substitutions, standing in for what is real. They are there not to tell it like it is but to invite and encourage pretense. They are a fantasy, a projection onto the Other that makes them less threatening. Stereotypes abound when there is distance. They are an invention, a pretense that one knows when the steps that would make real knowing possible cannot be taken -- are not allowed.' (bell hooks, Representing Whiteness in the Imagination)

The first point of issue is the notion 'representation', of which the 'stereotype' is 'one form', but surely its relation to the ontological structure and understanding of the observed 'Other' must be a consideration, apparently not. Secondly, the purpose of this representation is to 'invite and encourage pretense', is this the harmless process that is implied? It is grounded in fantasy and cannot/shouldn't be framed or misinterpreted as a truth, but exactly what it is, _pretense_. One must ask the use of this creative projection? The 'projection onto the Other makes them less threatening' is a striking example of the agenda of this method of rationalisation, and it shall also reveal a controlling influence inherent in such a world-view of cultural representations.

The second quote is taken from Terry Eagleton, and sets the tone for these proceedings rather well:

'Of course, to have a phenomenal knowledge of others may in fact be enough for using them to our own advantage. Nevertheless, it may not be felt sufficient for constructing the kind of universal subjectivity which ruling class requires for its ideological solidarity. For this purpose, it might be possible to attain something which, while not strictly knowledge, is nonetheless very like it. This pseudo-knowledge is known as the aesthetic.'

The relation indicated by Eagleton between the 'ruling class' and 'ideological solidarity' is perpetuated by 'the kind of universal subjectivity' which consolidates a power-base. Moreover, the aesthetic is the science of this ideology. As Edmund Burke will detail, his cultural and personal prejudices combine to produce an acutely Eurocentric, short-sighted, and heavily flawed justification for his prejudices.

'Black bodies, reflecting none, or but a few rays, with regard to sight are but as so many vacant spaces dispersed among the objects we view.' '(Edmund Burke)

Simply the demarcation of the 'we' from the 'Black bodies' alludes to one of his more deep seated distinctions, and will be shown to provide a motivation for a surprising number of 'intelligent', 'rational', notables of the western philosophical tradition.

In the 18th century it was the aesthetic treatise of Edmund Burke and the pre-critical work of the 'great' Immanuel Kant which investigated and allowed the sublime to become 'both and effect of an object which inspired terror and the disposition of a subject capable of aesthetic judgment'. This method of framing the issue allowed thinkers to _generate_ the distinction between I-Other, which in a time of mass human bondage, slavery, the usurping of land, and contact with Other cultures was ideologically practical. Another indication of implicit or explicit attitudes towards aesthetic discourse is visible via a 'provocative silence on the relation between the sublime and the exotic':

'...that the philosophical discourses of sublimity turn away from such embodied (and often "exotic") forms at the same time that they abjure the relevance of historical and cultural contingencies which have thrown them into the line of vision. The repetitive motions with which the national, cultural, racial, or gendered bodies of the sublime are erased in order to assert the "naturalness" of aesthetic vision indicates a persistent anxiety and ambivalence surrounding the relationship between subjectivity, aesthetics, and the production of images -- one could even say stereotype - of difference.'

The underlying tension is one that has been alluded to throughout, and will be explored from an alternative position in the following chapter. It seems as if the historical method of 'Enframing' and 'revealing' has at its core a denial or uncertainty with regards to its confrontation of an 'Other' ideology, system of beliefs, and/or values, thus we have the see-through task of concealing the blatant subjectivity and culturally specific attitudes and philosophies of the West. This does not mean that 'Other' societies do not also partake in analogously exclusive and insular traditions, but that they have not the dominance in thought nor the permeating influence in culture, and as such cannot claim to represent an arbitrary, 'natural', and universal 'New Age World Picture'.

Armstrong posits that:

'First, according to a "transcendent" interpretation of the sublime which buys into the rhetoric of philosophical aesthetics, sublime vision is problematic because it harbors with itself the contradictions and regret which arise from confrontations with difference and the inevitable failure of aesthetic discourse to satisfy desires for totality and unity.'

In Kant's third Critique it could be the image of a unity with a deity, or strictly subjectively, the union of rational and imaginative faculties that achieve the 'desires' of 'unity' and 'totality'.

  
'_**Making the sublime less terrifying or obscure**_ is the business of aesthetic discourse in Burke's Enquiry.' \[italics mine\]

_'_A Philosophical Enquiry In the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful'_, _excited much academic and intellectual interest in the late 1700s. Burke's Enquiry provides a detailed yet inconsistent account of the properties (vastness, darkness, etc.) generally understood to be sublime. The primary distinction which he bases his theory in, is the conflict of the sexes, the feminine is paired with beauty, whilst in opposition we pair the masculine to the sublime. Unsurprisingly the next division is that of light and dark, the former is matched with beauty and the feminine, the latter is respectively paired with masculine, and dark.

'It is significant that one of Burke's primary examples of the terrifying natural "effects of blackness" complicates his associational matrix. Here, it is precisely a _black female_ which is sublime, suggesting that the feminine can be both (safely) beautiful and, sublime and threatening.'

This is significant in that it quite transparently indicates that the limit of the distinctions he has drawn is painfully subject to an implicitly racist ideological motive.

Meg Armstrong's assertive and apt revisionist critique is resounding in many respects, not least her surmise of:

'Burke's attempt to provide the "invariable and certain laws' of taste outlined'/ 'the associational matrixes he sketches-and in the process of illustrating, often confounds-are also exclusionary: they mark not only the contours of beauty and sublimity but also cast some bodies "outside" the boundaries Burke has set for each category of aesthetic experience.'

The example of the black female more than clearly demonstrates his dualistic tendency to appropriate meaning and value according to his personal regard for such experiences, and as such his examples are far from convincing. As Meg Armstrong states:

'Now it is not only that the sublime has to do with pain and danger, and beauty with the pleasures of love, but also that the dangers of the sublime relate to the active and "the masculine," and the pleasures of beauty to the passive tenderness of "the feminine." Burke's rhetoric elicits the reader's appreciation of the "naturalness" of such associations, and directs attention away from any already-constructed cultural base.'

Which of course it could never be representative of, because the author was a well recognized clear sighted, intelligent, just, rational being, or because it was assumed or merely a given that objectivity is something _others _need to incorporate into their thinking. The modern scientific dawn had swept and promised the fruits of _scientific truth _free from the contamination and constraint of cultural specificity, or that at the time the machinery and ethos Empire was embedded in the psyches of a society.

Nonetheless Burke insists on playing on the 'naturalness' of his associations, the gender opposition being a prime example of his use of culturally specific association to create the illusion of an a-historically fixed external valuation of the given terms, the sublime and beauty respectively.

Burke's passionate defense of the natural connection between darkness and terror leads him into a lengthy refutation of Locke's ideas concerning darkness, most notably his contention;

'That darkness is not naturally an idea of terror; and that, though an excessive light is painful to the sense, the greatest excess of darkness is no ways troublesome' (E p.143)

Armstrong delivers a striking quote with regard to Burke's justification for the 'natural uneasiness' or 'terror' observed by \[one might infer non-black\] persons.

'Darkness is terrible before all association with particular things. To support this point, Burke recounts the story of Mr Cheselden, a surgeon who removes a young boy's cataracts and restores his sight. Given that the boy has been blind since birth, Burke argues that his reactions to darkness, or blackness, can be taken as entirely 'natural' \[this claim is not qualified in any way, does it mean he is familiar enough with social convention and practices not to be totally excluded from the norm, or that because he was blind his sense of sight was 'pure' and thus 'natural'\]. The boy had seen a black object and felt 'great uneasiness' \[it is most implausible that every encounter with darkness or blackness elicited this fearful reaction, for it would surely disrupt a good portion of his waking and sleeping life\] which was succeeded by horror a few months later 'upon accidentally seeing a Negro woman' (E, p.144).

If it were 'natural' to see darkness as a blind boy, but one had never seen a black woman, might it be a plausible assumption that his terror might have been inspired by the '_accidental_' nature of his discovery. The frightening aspect of this is that it seems to rationalize and perpetuate an unhealthy attitude regarding the 'naturalness' of such flimsy and derogatory associations.

Armstrong's own opinion of the interpretation should not go amiss, for she thinks:

'It may be worth speculating that in Burke's account the threat to the boy centers upon the provocation of a reactive (and not controlling) stance in him, aligning him with the passivity of the feminine, here given the added iconic valence of subordination through slavery. Burke's categorization of black as terrible in _itself _(by _nature_) may be interpreted, in this example as an attempt to control the signification of the black and the female for the masculine gaze by asserting that this reaction is natural and unavoidable and would not put the (ultimate) agency or power of the boy into question.'

The validity of this speculation is subject to many criteria, firstly it was indicated that his alignment of opposites and his example of the sublime are not consistent and thus hint at an ideological motive. It is not perhaps too far-fetched to ascribe his prejudices to their situatedness in the rise and history of Western imperialism, if we perhaps accept a hermeneutical approach to interpretation and critique.

We shall now move forward to tackle Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment, as presented by Meg Armstrong's paper. It is Kant's main aim to clear and isolate all 'interests', or 'secondary considerations' in judgments of beauty or the sublime. After an extended look at the dispositions toward aesthetic experience in reaction to gender and national affiliation he, '...extends Burke's inchoate references to the "effects of blackness" and peoples of "duskier complexions" to elaborate a typing of national characteristics according to the propensity of different national subjects for beautiful and sublime feelings.'

Kant's emphasis is on the 'dispositions' as opposed to the "nature of external things", this is indeed a reductionist tendency which has to look no farther than it's own motives to justify or rationalize conflict. Kant proves his inability to escape subjectivity towards 'pure' judgments when he says:

''...in fact, dark coloring and black eyes are more closely related to the sublime, blue eyes blonde coloring to the beautiful." (O,p.54)

An assertion based upon nothing resembling reason, it might be useful to note that before the Critique of Judgment, a less well known pre-critical publication under the title, Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime, was published 1763\. This is only six years after Burke's Enquiry and a striking resemblance in their tone and references to 'the effects of blackness' seem to pervade, albeit unfortunately.

Kant's next task is, 'to portray the characters of peoples in detail, but I sketch only a few features that express the feeling of sublime and the beautiful which they show.' Now this racial essentialism is most degrading, and indeed the work of one the 'greatest 20th century Western philosophers', as we will see the notion of aesthetic classification and categorization is never far from thought. As Armstrong posits, 'his supposition of racial or national bases for aesthetic philosophy, is preparatory to the systematic incorporation of metaphorical racial differences into "science". A classic case of positing the proverbial horse before the cart is offered succinctly by Armstrong:

'Kant, however, brushes aside the question of climate, and not only establishes a general aesthetic philosophy of the beautiful and the sublime, but proceeds to _use_ this aesthetic to classify nations according to aesthetic (and moral) dispositions.'

Again, the illusionary departure from prejudice towards the light of 'scientific', objective, value and truth has eluded his practice, instead his cultural bias takes an unassuming 'backseat' in his propositions and lays the foundation for his conclusions.

Section four of his _Observations _he clearly elaborates as to his classifications by casting a 'fleeting glance', 'over other parts of the world':

'It is here that we find generalizations about the tastes of Arabs, Japanese, Chinese, 'Negroes of Africa', and North American 'savages'. What had previously been said about the Spanish and French is here applied to the Arabs and Persians, in whose national character the European traits are magnified and excessive. Thus, the Arabs : Spanish :: Persians : French :: Japanese : Englishmen, with the Indians and Chinese so enchanted by the grotesque as to elude European classificatory categories altogether, and the African having, 'by nature no feeling that rises above the trifling' (O, p.110)

The blatant Eurocentric position held by Kant are unmitigated or qualified except via gossip and undoubtedly a fervent social climate regarding the 'discovery' of other nations. It resembles perhaps an early effort at cultural Darwinism to an extent, with the European aesthetic ideals of the sublime and beauty being distorted by 'others' reflections of European standards and values.

A verbatim quote might be valuable, and used to good effect, therefore it might well serve this point well, to consider that; ' whenever one travels, what one discovers is always the self.'

African philosopher, Tsenay Serequeberhan in an article on,

'Eurocentricism in Philosophy: The Case of Immanuel Kant' he observes that:

'it should be noted that Kant was well aware of the faulty character of the empirical information about non-European peoples that was available to him. In his review of the second part of Herder's 'Ideas for a Philosophy of the History of Mankind', 1785 he notes that:

"...working with a mass of descriptions dealing with different lands, it is possible to prove, if one cares to do so...that \[native\] Americans with Negroes are relatively inferior races in their intellectual capacities, but on the other hand, according to reports just as plausible, that their natural potentialities are on the same level as those of an other inhabitants on the planet." (On History, 'Idea for a History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View', p12)

Why then did he not 'care' to consider the contrary and the 'just as plausible' positive reports regarding Native Americans, Negroes, and other non-European peoples?

Tsenay continues: 'As Kant himself tells us, what is at stake-contra Herder, whose work he is reviewing -- is the making of "natural distinctions...classification based on hereditary coloration...\[and\]...the notion of race."

Moreover, all of this is to be understood in terms of,

"...the destiny of the human race in general \[which\] is perpetual progress, and its perfection is simple, but in all respects very useful, Idea of the goal to which, conforming to the purpose of providence, we have to direct our efforts." (Reviews of Herder's Ideas for a Philosophy of the history of Mankind, p47)

This 'Idea' is taken by Tsenay to represent an 'imperious notion of Occidental superiority', which is not antagonistic with respect to much of the evidence surveyed thus far.

If we may now return to Meg Armstrong's revisionist paper, as it reinforces many of the aforementioned points with regard to Kant's sweeping history of taste.

'The text asserts that a uniformity of sound taste \[a universal aesthetic principle\] has returned to a particular time in history, when in fact the suppression of various (imagined) national tastes-of which the Indian and Chinese have been classed as grotesque --is the aim of the text's closing remarks:

"Nothing now is more to be desired than that of the false glitter, which so easily deceives, should not remove us unawares from _noble simplicity_ \[italics mine\]: but especially that the as yet undiscovered secret education be rescued from the old illusions, in order early to elevate the moral feeling in the breast of every young world citizen to a lively sensitivity, so that all delicacy of feeling may not amount to merely the fleeting and idle enjoyment of judging, with more or less taste, what goes around us" (o, pp. 115-116)

"The moral feeling" requires "us" "a" finer taste, which rests on something apparently more permanent than that which "goes on around us". It is inferred from these statements that Kant is positing an ideologically driven structure of universal value to be instituted and 'to elevate the moral feeling of in the breast of every young world citizen', surely this is to the detriment of 'other' value systems?

The third critique allows Kant to establish the primacy of the subject's response to the object in aesthetic discourse, rather than focusing on the qualities of the object itself. Moreover, because he ceases to draw on the nationalistic character of various tastes and imaginations he creates 'the subject of aesthetic experience' which is presented as a legitimate quasi-scientific basis for aesthetic and moral judgments?

Kant reconciles the 'threat' and 'terror' of the sublime via, 'the motion of "encompassing" the threat in nature, or the sensible, might obviously extend itself to an imperial gesture of incorporating the 'adventurous Arab', or other sublime characters in the world of nations by pointing elsewhere, to a 'supersensible totality' from which judgments of taste draw their universal character and ultimate legitimacy. It is the legacy of such a 'master' of western philosophy which is emphatically rebutted, and considered as unphilosophical ideology dressed up as reason, and as such should be acknowledged and revised as a pioneering few scholars attempt to do.

**African Philosophy**

It might appear rhetorical to begin this chapter with the question, What is African Philosophy? However, it is extremely pertinent to the inquiry, for reasons that shall become more lucid in due course.

It is revealing that in, The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, under the heading African Philosophy reads;

'Although no _continental unanimity_ \[italics mine\] is assumed, traditional African conceptions of the cosmos in many instances in involve homogenous ontology's that cut across the Natural/Supernatural opposition in Western philosophy.'

It will be argued that the 'unanimity' so desired by Western scholars is reductionism in method, for reasons outlined earlier with regard to popular and influential 'universalistic' theories. It will also be shown that African thought doesn't possess the inherent dualist dichotomy arising from Western the notion of Being.

African Philosophy is in a unique predicament \[especially in relation to Western Philosophy\], in that for us \[the African philosopher\]:

'to appreciate the "to be" of our historicalness means to confront European neo-colonial subjugation: the politics of economic, cultural, and scientific subordination.' He continues, 'unlike Heidegger, for us \[the African philosopher\], the question of our existence, of our 'to be', is an inherently political question. To neglect the politics of this question, in our case, is to disregard the question itself. For, when we ask or reflect on our humanity, when we examine the actuality, the "substance of our existence" as human beings, there we are confronted by an internalized imperious Europe dominant over the contradictory of our own indigent and subjected indigenousness.'

(Philosophy and Post-Colonial Africa, Tsenay Serequeberhan)

As may have been inferred, Tsenay takes his cue from Heidegger's contribution to the hermeneutical method of enquiry, or simply put, that 'The essence of an entity lies in its _to be'_. This is incorporated into Serequeberhan's own perception of African philosophy as such, "We recognize both Europe and Africa as sites of human becoming, the ontological explorations of the 'to be' of human existence, which Heidegger undertakes from with the ontic confines of European modernity, can be passed from within the ontic confines of other cultures and histories.'

Which is a reasonable assumption, considering that the interest in hermenuetics in African Philosophy:

'...arises out of the reality of crisis: a generalized identity crisis due to the presence of a culture- a foreign and dominating tradition -- and the necessity for a 'self'- affirmation in construction of and authentic culture and tradition.'

It is then posited that the emergence of philosophy presupposes some such 'crisis', as: 'philosophic discourse is the rhetorical effective enunciation -- the bringing to utterance -- of the historicity of existence out of and within a specific historicalness.'

The most valid example of this emergence or growth of philosophy is perhaps ancient Greece, and it worth bearing in mind the political and social flux that they underwent. Not least their trade links with distant civilizations, especially the near-eastern cultural and conceptual trading. It is against such a historical backdrop that one views the crystallization of the Hellenistic identity in opposition to the Others/'Barbarians' of whom they were so indebted to for the resulting nation (i.e. the Persian invasions, Phoenician colonies, Egyptian colonies etc.)

  
An example of the theoretical colonial legacy as left by those generally regarded to as, 'greatly esteemed' European thinkers is cited from Kant's, Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime (1784):

'The Negroes of Africa have by nature no feelings that rise above the trifling. Mr Hume \[the prominent and influential Scottish moral philosopher\] challenges anyone to cite a single example in which a Negro has shown talents, and assert that among the hundreds of thousands of blacks who are transported elsewhere from their countries, although many of them have been set free, still not a single one was ever found who presented anything great in art or science or any other praise-worthy quality, even though among the whites some continually rise aloft from the lowest rabble, and through superior gifts earn respect in the world. So fundamental is the difference between these two races of man, and it appears to be as great in regard to mental capacities as in color.' (_O_, pp. 110-111)

Now these assertions are outrageous, especially from a man who never left the security of his country, nor native city, and who proceeds to illuminate us on the experience, the lives, the enslavement, and damningly inhumane treatment of the 'Negroes of Africa'.

It is best to take this time to explain the reference in this thesis to the role of African literature as part of a distinctly hermeneutical philosophical discourse. As Hans Kohn remarks with respect to Herder's, 'On the New German Literature',

'Nationality lived above in its civilizations, its main instrument was its language, not an artificial instrument, but a gift of God, the guardian of the national community and the matrix of its community.'

A later look at the work of African novelist Chinua Achebe will help us decipher this 'gift of God' and its impact on the direction of African thought, especially the cultural currency of notions of Ontology and Aesthetics as they manifest in society. It is the intention of this aspect of African 'Philosophy' to reveal the ways in which the impositions of 'foreign' languages played a monumental role in the cultural disenfranchisement of African peoples.

Firstly we will turn attention to a Algerian Francophone writer, Frantz Fanon, who whilst practicing medicine in his civil war ravaged nation, wrote of the situation in his distinctive role as a clinical psychologist. The book, Towards the African Revolution, contains a very appropriate chapter on, Racism and Culture:

'The setting up of the colonial system does not itself bring about the death of the native culture./...the aim sought is rather a continued agony than a total disappearance of the pre-existing culture. This culture, once living and open to the future, becomes closed, fixed in the colonial status, caught in the yoke of oppression. Both present and mummified, it testifies against its members. It defines them in fact without appeal. The cultural mummification leads to a mummification of individual thinking. The apathy so universally noted among colonial peoples is but the logical consequence of this operation. The reproach of inertia constantly directed at 'the native' is utterly dishonest. As though it were possible for a man to evolve otherwise than within a framework of a culture that recognizes him and that he decides to assume.' (Towards the African Revolution, F.Fanon)

This quote relates to the issue of African Philosophers tackling the 'inherently political' problems facing the experience of Africans in the world. It must be pointed out that the existence of Philosophy, or 'reflection' has been integral to the lives of Africans for millennia, Philosophy 'proper', in terms of Plato, Descartes, Wittgenstein, etc. is a relatively recent and exclusive domain. It is an aim to draw the distinction between African Traditional religion/African Thought as a pervasive pattern of cognition, in contrast to the 'universalistic' ideologies perpetuated by many mainstream Western philosophers.

As Fanon points out later on page 47;

'Racism bloats and disfigures the face of the culture that practices it. Literature , the plastic arts, songs for shopgirls, proverbs, habits, patterns, whether they set out to attack it or vulgarize it, restore racism. This means that a social group, a country, a civilization, cannot be unconsciously racist.'

It is the embeddedness of racism within a culture that Fanon observes, that strengthens the argument of African Philosophy not being approached as a pseudo-anthropological pursuit, or a Western interpretation of African thought, it must simply reflect a manifestation of a unique, culturally based world-view.

Works done by Raymond Williams, in his book, Art and Ideology in the African Novel, broaches some important points with regard to the role of Literature in African Thought and Philosophy.

Primarily he puts forward three versions of the concept ideology:

1- a system of beliefs characteristic of a particular class or group;

2- a system of illusionary beliefs-false ideas or false consciousness - which can be contrasted with true or scientific knowledge;

3- the general process of the production of meanings and ideas;

Now, although all three definitions are constantly in use, 1 and 3 seem to be the most accurate, although the second definition is intrinsically opposed to intuitive 'belief' on the basis of 'scientific knowledge'. Thus, it establishes itself in the role of _natural _opposition to 'false ideas/consciousness'. Still, the basis of agreement on empirical scientific truth is as subject to interpretation as intuitive insight or an analogous form of knowledge, therefore the 'natural' opposition alluded to is illusionary in my opinion.

Williams states the 'Art is not in itself an ideology. As one of the forms of social-consciousness, it has a particular relationship to ideology. this relationship, as Althusser would say, is not the same relationship between science and teleology.'

For, while science gives us a knowledge of empirical reality, art makes us 'see', 'perceive', and 'feel' reality. William continues; 'What art makes us 'see', and therefore gives to us in the from of 'seeing', 'perceiving', 'feeling' (which is not the from of knowing), it the ideology from which it is born, in which it bathes, from which it detaches itself as art, and to which it alludes.'

Thus it is asserted that African folktales express socially accepted ideas about goodness, virtue, and bravery, while songs go with activities such as threshing, dancing, funeral services and religious ceremonies. In more technologically and industrially 'advanced' societies where the state has come into being and nations have been born a class structure has emerged, we see literature being associated with the ruling class. It is such a background that the celebrated 1950's Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe broke social molds at the time to produce modern classics, positing a pre-colonial world of lost and 'mummified' traditions. He awoke many out of the 'apathy' described by Fanon to use art as a 'celebration', a self-assertive creation of a 'fictional' past tying into the cultural notion of past, present, and future, and the tensions between the fast encroaching notions of 'tradition' and 'modernity.

'The limited experience of the African world, which has historically provoked the reaction of superiority and arrogance, causes the reader to be struck by the strangeness of the world in African Literature, a strangeness not only on a realistic level but more significantly in the cultural world-view, or what Achebe calls the _**metaphysical landscape.' **_(P31 Achebe, Hegel, and the New Colonialism, M.Turner)

The resolute tone of his paper towards validating a distinct metaphysic of African experience and origin is certainly not exhaustive, but one hopes well detailed and illustrated. It is especially against the horizon of pervasively dominant theories of Western philosophers and 'other' cultures, that;

i.e. 'In Hegel's thinking the universal and homogenous state is the peak of historical progress and will signal the end of history. For Hegel, that state arrived with Napoleon. The universal - every place - and homogenous - equality for every person \[and personhood has been withheld to various 'primitive' peoples\] - state is the desired goal, because it ends with the dialectic of the master and slave.'

This 'end' is not a positive prospect for a 'philosopher' with any ounce of humanism, nor a person who has the aim of addressing the crucial questions regarding our peculiar co-existence on this frail planet. Yet, Achebe's treatment of the first encounters between a Nigerian Igbo society and the West (Europeans) is subtly designed to reflect the deep ontological and ethical issues. '..the intrusion into the African world made the basis of tragedy unworkable: because of the conflicting sets of values no transgression against either can be seen clearly as the cause of another' fall. Rather than catharsis, a cleansing of the emotions through the re-establishment of moral order, a vague uneasiness and dis-satifaction remain after each novel.' (M.Turner, Achebe, Hegel, and the New Colonialism)

What is proposed by Achebe is a revaluation of the notion of tragedy in the context of colonialism: 'real tragedy is one that goes on hopelessly, forever, in a corner , in an untidy spot.'

It is the continuos nature of the tensions throughout his works that convey the tragedy, and it is proposed that these manifestations of deeply relevant issues to African society be regarded as philosophical discourse in their own right. The lack of a _**doxagraphic tradition**_ analogous to the Western notions of philosophy is unfortunate, but it does not consequently mean that they have no philosophies, nor that these ideas might be presented and conceived of in analogous terms.

Conceptions of Art in African thought will dominate the closing sections of this paper as it is this fantastic medium which has been consistently shown to communicate a 'metaphysical landscape' in Achebe's words, ontic conditions, or simply the conscious reflections of experience communicated through artistic expression.

It is important to note the traditional sense of art, it is a _communal _expression and embraces all peoples reality's as a result of its flexibility/dynamism. The term 'celebration' must be placed in context with the 'traditional' notion of art, art expresses a people's reality and in that way gathers them together, physically and conceptually, thus embodying the use of the term, 'celebration'.

A statement of intent taken from the author of the novel, Things Fall Apart, goes as follows;

'We...are committed to reclaiming the rich heritage of Africa, every inch of it, and redrawing the contours of African history which in the hands of others has been drawn, and is drawn, with great malice and falsehood...The perspectives will be many, reflecting the complexity of the problem but out of the welter will emerge a sound, clear vision of the way forward.' (Achebe, Colonial Criticism)

It is Achebe's own admission of 'reclaiming' and 'redrawing' which enlivens the debate regarding the role of the novelist/essayist

as philosopher, which in this case is persuasive. The vehicle for the transmission of thought is not perhaps readily analogous in Western tradition, but nonetheless it serves the function of reflection, 'celebration', the posing of socially/morally pertinent questions, and narrator in 'artistic expression'.

' \[philosophic\] Interpretation presupposes a tradition, and ...a tradition as such is always interpreted.'

The point of this excerpt is to acknowledge the stunning insight of an African intellectual experiencing the identity 'crisis' as described earlier, and responding via the instruments of his colonial inheritance, Literature and Philosophy.

Achebe was born to a Ibo and Christian family, and was subsequently church educated at a missionary society school. It is the irony and inherent dichotomy of the modern scholarly African that the tensions between education, history, and culture invoke an urge to reconcile, this was achieved by Achebe's outstanding literary efforts: Things Fall Apart, No Longer at Ease, and The Arrow of God.

The issues addressed are how disruptive for a culture are major changes in spatial and temporal organization. Achebe portrays substantial alterations in both. For example, the Christians on their arrival are designated by the village elders a plot of land in the Evil Forest; the British move the center of authority from the village to their outpost, making it a spatial, a well as legal center; the new religion simplicity at least) imposes a different sense of time, of organizing the year. These disruptions can be perceived as the colonizers implicit or explicit 'mummification' of important cultural practices, and orientations. For, the ways in which things were purposefully arranged turns out to be the adhesive qualities of the society, consequently; Things Fall Apart.

The dynamic and adaptable nature of the social structures in Igboland allow experience to be expressed in creative activity, in short channeling the disruptive and emotive aspects of seeking a unifying 'ultimate reality'.

  
'I offer _Mbari_ to you as one illustration of my pre-colonial inheritance - of art as celebration of my reality; of art in its social dimension; of the creative potential in all of us and the need to exercise this latent energy again and again in artistic expression and communal, co-operative enterprises.'

In doing so we are encouraged by the sharing of ideas, conceptions, thoughts, and mutually combine and create a common reality as such. This particular process described is detailed in the book, Thing Fall Apart, and it is the notion of _Mbari_ that will be explored for philosophical content with regard to ontology and aesthetic inquiry.

'The Igbo world is an arena for the interplay of forces. It is a dynamic world of movement and flux. Igbo art reflecting this world-view, is never tranquil, but mobile and active, even aggressive.' (The Igbo World and Its Art, C.Achebe)

This example of Achebe's own culture's assumptions, conventions, beliefs, and thoughts on art cannot and shouldn't be taken to be representative of an entire continent's multifarious practices. The binding forces are the shared experiences of the peoples of Africa, in experience and thought patterns. Western scholars have previously been intent discovering or highlighting the ancestral, or 'magical', or supernatural aspects of African beliefs and thought. It is the direction of this paper to view African notions through artistic traditions, which though varied offer general principles relevant to their respective societies; Initiations, education, religious ceremony, etc.

'...art emerges from privacy into the public domain. there are no private collections among the Igbo beyond personal ritual objects like the Ikenga. indeed, the very concept of collections would be antithetical to the Igbo artistic intention. Collections by their very nature will impose rigid, artistic attitudes and conventions on creativity which the Igbo sensibility goes out of its way to avoid. The purposeful neglect of the painstakingly and devoutly accomplished _Mbari _houses with all the art objects in them, as soon as the primary mandate of their creation has been served, provides a significant insight into the _Igbo aesthetic value as process rather than product_ \[italics mine\]. Process is motion while product is rest. When the product is preserved or venerated, the impulse to repeat the process is compromised \[This is a point which is unexplored, and yet it appears to fit into our general notions of art. For, it is peculiar to Western art in particular that certain types of 'classic' forms be reinterpreted, but never matched or repeated. The idea of an immutable form of Beauty, and its communication via genius, from God is present in commentary on the works of De Vinci, to Beethoven\]. Therefore the Igbo choose to eliminate the product and retain the process so that every occasion and every generation will receive its own impulse and kinesis of creation. Interestingly, this aesthetic disposition receives powerful endorsement from the tropical climate which provide an abundance of materials for making art, such as wood, as well as formidable enemies of stasis, such as humidity and the termite. Visitors to Igboland are often shocked to see that artifacts are rarely accorded any particular value on account of age alone.' (C.Achebe, The Igbo World and Its Art)

The most obvious reason that people are often 'shocked' to find that artifacts are not automatically accorded value on the basis of age alone, may be that it is in direct opposition to the Western notion of aesthetic value. Here we have identified at least one point of ideological departure in African modes of thought and the Western tradition of enquiry. The 'dynamic' aspect of, at least, Igbo aesthetic principles deals with the persistent problem which has dogged Western thought about 'housing' art, and placing it in 'context' is overcome by the emphasis on process rather than product. The problem is resolved by members of the society each expressing artistic intention, and as such having a social and experiential connection to the communal processes of art making.

Let us swiftly turn attention to the intriguing idea and structure of the _Mbari_, the shrine as ritual and artistic process, a connection to the thoughts of society. Among the Owerri Igbo the shrines were made to major community Gods, Ala as the earth deity, source of fertility, wealth and yams, and tended to dominate these sculptural monuments. With the growth of Christianity and the decline of Traditional religious worship the size and numbers of _Mbari_ have also declined, but have also changed stylistically to incorporate the changing political, and social environment. It is the adaptability of these structures which has in fact allowed them to survive, their role as mediator of the inner reflections of its people means that they have a means of integrating and giving meaning to the threatening, destructive, or unfortunate, by a communal 'celebration'.

'The decision to erect an _Mbari_ constitutes a response to a major crises in the community, such as famine, plague, excessive death, drought, warfare, and/or poor harvests. these punishments are believed to be inflicted by Ala when she has been offended by a community. The erection of _Mbari_ will appease and placate her, and remove calamity from the community.'

It has been most strongly denied by Nwachukwu-Agbada, that the _Mbari _is a shrine for worship, especially if one bears in mind the artistic intentions as described by Achebe. Instead, it is seen as an essentially religious activity, a sacrifice serving to (re)bind the community to its deity.

Herbert Cole, who has extensively researched Mbari argues that 'its adaptive character and sense of regeneration and renewal, as well as its integrated sculptures, paintings, and architecture, have served as stimulus to groups of artists in other parts of the country.'

'In this connection, Cole contends that Mbari should be considered more as a process rather than a form. In fact, informants described Mbari as a "dance" because of the interrelated and overlapping subsidiary art forms and rituals.'

Again, this view of the phenomena of Mbari serves to reinforce Achebe's understanding of Igbo culture and thought, but it is the 'adaptable' nature of this communal artistic and conceptual musing.

'Mbari artists draw on and transform existing imagery form stories, myths, proverbs, and life-forms, as well as occasionally creating new images. Some artists speak of dreams as sources of inspiration. Many characters are topical, such as the white man, and there are many items of modernity and prestige, such as Western clothes, machines, Christian paraphernalia, umbrellas, imported cloth, etc.'

The regenerative capacity of the Mbari to mediate societies fears, desires, taboos, and beliefs is extraordinary in this respect, and is significant as the process of art 'coming into being' \[according to culturally specific convention and custom\] in this process is central.

'The Mbari process is an act of cosmic renewal, a harmonization of opposing forces, a fusion through materials and workers of the real world, the sky world and the underworld, and, above all, a celebration of life.'

The notion of 'uniting' opposites, and harmonization pervades African thought to the extent that in the past many Western academics have delved no further than 'supernatural' elements of African thought. It might be posited that this use of art to mediate reflects a profound metaphysical statement regarding the 'nearness of the spirit world', in African life and thought.

A striking example of the prevalence of this it might be useful to refer to the book, African Religions and Philosophy:

'Death transposes the music of life from one key to another, switching it from the rhythm of the physical to the rhythm of the spiritual world.'

The idea of a continuity between two 'worlds' permeates the character of the perceptions and expressions of its societal members, who through the processes of art affirm and rediscover the relation.

'A number of other African societies regard man as a body and soul. The Bachwa (Congo Kinshas) think that the soul of man is small and visible in the pupil of the eye. At death the eye breaks, the soul departs and the body ceases to function. The Bambuti (Congo Kinshasa) hold that the soul leaves the body through the nose, at death.'

The relevance of these examples is to highlight the type of variance between general African notions of being, and yet it is possible to identify prominent similarities which bind general patterns of thought. It is clear that we may confer from the African peoples considered that:

'To appreciate more fully the Akamba (or African) concept of the spirit world, we need to put it into its ontological context. Akamba ontology can be classified into five modes of existence: (I) God, the Originator and Sustainer of all things, (ii) Aimu and the living - dead, (iii) Man, (iv) animals and plants, and (v) objects without the capacity to have life. Abstract things like ethics, morals, customs, values, etc. have no separate life of their own./

This is an intensely anthropocentric ontology. It is a unity centered upon Man, in such a way that death cannot destroy him. To destroy Man would, in effect, mean destroying the whole coherence of being, including the destruction of the Creator.' (p131-132, African Religions and Philosophy)

The underlying ontological principles which underlie African thought will be sought through an integral element in its ability to manifest, through Art.

Kwame Anthony Appiah, author of 1992 New York Times Notable book of the Year, In My Father's House, presents a persuasive argument concerning the 'Philosophy of culture'. In the proceeding paragraphs we will explore some of his most pertinent themes. The notion of Tradition is a much flouted and obscured term, and Appiah navigates well through his minefield.

'For one of the marks of traditional life is the extent to which beliefs, activities, habits of mind, and behavior in general are shot through with what Europeans and Americans would call 'religion'.'

(p108, In My Father's House, A. Appiah)

Indeed, it is because understanding traditional religion is so central to the conceptual issues that modernization raises that philosophical discussion of the status of traditional religion has been so central in recent African philosophy.'

Appiah then proceeds to set out the philosophical questions that should readily be applied to observation of African 'ritual', 3 distinct types of understanding are called for, is;

(i) 'understanding the ritual beliefs that underlie it;

(ii) understanding the historic sources of both the ritual and the belief;

(iii) understanding what sustains them.'

These principles are applied to a number of examples Appiah offers, a striking one presents itself as an explanation of the ritual significance of gold dust as an offering. 'But notice that this explanation \[of the 'cultural anthropologist'\] of the presence of gold dust as symbolic takes us out of the arena of understanding the cultural acts themselves into examining their origins. This resort to origins is not, however, what makes it true that the gold dust functions symbolically./

Now the gold dust is not a purely conventional symbol. It is possible to use gold dust in this context as a symbol of respect, because in other contexts the giving of gold dust is a sign of respect.'

He goes on to explain that the use of gold dust as money forms the practical basis for the use of gold dust in a ritual act, as an offering to a spirit of whom can have no practical 'use' for money. These examples are crucial in that they detail how ontological truths form the foundation to religious elements of Africa culture and philosophy.

Appiah reminds us that 'a symbol is always somebody's symbol: it is something that means something to someone.' And as such cannot be viewed in the role of the detached observing, not influencing, altering or involved in the 'datum' or results. The refutation of the 'cultural anthropologist's position is based on the level of understanding at which the observer seeks and observes ontic 'truths'.

'And once we have seen that the ritual setting is ceremonious, we need only the further premise that all ceremony has elements of symbolism to complete a syllogism:

ritual entails symbolism.

I do not myself have theories as to why human beings so closely bind together ceremony and symbolism/ But that the prevalence of symbolism in Asante derives from the conception of the relations between people and spirits as relations between persons...'

'Many symbolic ritual acts have this character. They are not arbitrary signs, like words or salutes; they are acts that draw on their meaning from the _**non-ritual significance of relevantly similar performances.**_ /

What makes them symbolic is the recognition by the agents that these acts in ritual contexts do not work the standard way.'

(My Father's House, A.Appiah, p113)

It is upon this framing of the issue of Tradition and 'ritual' that we shall view the following sources, with the insight of 'non-ritual significance', and the three tiered levels of understanding required for an authentic and relevant reading. Before we pursue the final sources regarding African thought and art, let us take special note of the work of Robin Horton's work in the philosophy of African religion;

'Horton's thesis is not that traditional religion is a kind of science \[in the aspect of truth seeking 'goals'\] but that theories in the two domains are similar in these crucial respects. The major _difference _in the contents of the theories, he argues, is that traditional religious theory is couched in terms of _**personal forces**_, while natural scientific theory is couched in terms of _**impersonal forces**_. The basic claim strikes me as immensely plausible.' (In My Father's House, A.Appiah, p121)

It is indeed a very reasonable supposition, one that from herein will be an acknowledged and incorporated premise, it will elucidated in further depth in the conclusion.

K.Anayawu at the University of Lagos, Nigeria has published an outstanding piece of unique and insightful work called, 'The Idea of Art in African thought'. It takes the form of a critical evaluation of the key concepts, terms, and beliefs which are pertinent to his study, as such his introduction begins by describing the relation between art and a society's notion of 'ultimate reality' \[ontology or being\]. Anayawu goes further by claiming that:

'Theories of art see to be determined by metaphysical assumptions about reality and the epistemological attitude appropriate for understanding or knowing that reality.' (p235...)

His observations are founded upon the premise that;

'...the distinctive traits of all cultures are manifested in their art forms; and this explains why those who are aware of the Greek, the European, the African, the Indian and the Chinese art forms, for example, can easily recognize the art objects of each of these cultures.' (p,235-236...)

Essentially what is being asserted , and one tends to agree, that art objects reflect certain 'ontic' principles which are specific to the cultural, religious, and political world-view of such a society. A charge of \[cultural\] relativism may be leveled at Anayawu which resembles the 'national characteristics' described by Kant, yet it presupposes no judgment of value, and as explained later the relativist' position 'cannot be maintained'.

'Forms of art reveal the mental world of a people or culture.'

This crucial point is reiterated to define the method inquiry into the art and thought unique to African experience, using 'grounded experience' and the inherent assumptions drawn from such experience is subsequently presented as a current or mode of thought, characteristic of the respective experience.

Anayanwu sets forth a view which is a clear departure from the European philosopher's 'universalist' tendencies, he replaces this with something that corresponds to distinct cultural, artistic reflections and musings of the people. It is quite reasonable, as he asserts, to refute the common relevance and validity of the teaching of Wittgenstein, Ayer, and Plato as a contribution to the philosophic tradition of Africa. If philosophy is an expression of culture, of experience within that given culture, it is easy to see why the 'universalist's contentions are untenable.

Anayanwu responds to the charge of relativism by stating that, 'I do not believe philosophy is the study of 'being', or accept the ideas of Plato merely on the authority of Plato and his followers.' He explains why the assertion that:

'everything is relative'

Because, 'The theorem of logical systems requires an assumption outside that system.'

What he is advocating is that 'we' acknowledge that_different_ thought systems all considered to be valuable, cannot be based on the unanimity of 'the European world-vision alone', whilst the alternative is not simply cultural relativism.

It is unfortunate that academic philosophy is largely addressing itself to academic philosophers and not to those whom professional philosophers should be serving, that is, human beings in their cultural and historical circumstances.

for, 'A philosophy which speaks , even indirectly, only to philosophers is not philosophy at all... For the business of philosophy is to articulate the principles by which man can live; not just as a scientist, citizen, religious man or whatever; but as a whole man that he is' (Kaplan, 1961, p.4)

Now, the above passage certainly resounds around the annals of the history of Western philosophy, as the Socratic revolution began under the guise of actively irritating, in the role of the 'gad-fly of the state', the metaphysical and moral considerations of the time. Without wandering too far into another area of discussion it must be highlighted that again, when Wittgenstein arrived as the Savior of modern Western philosophy it was to save itself from being tricked by the semantic paradox of 'luring the fly from the bottle'. In short, it was the analytic trend which was becoming ever insulated from the real questions of the 'whole' man, that Wittgenstein provided a refreshing unfamiliar line of thought, but is it enough to exorcise the ghosts of imperialist thinker's?

The important issue regarding African philosophy is not whether it is 'systematic', 'logical', or 'critical', in an analogous form to that of the western tradition, but 'whether it is true to experience and worthy of African life.'

'to by-pass experience in the pursuit of truth is to make oneself God' (Kaplan, 1961, p27)

And, it is to this end that 'science' has established itself as the religion of the modern world, this statement needs qualification which shall be provided in the conclusion, but it is useful to bear this in mind with a profound quote taken from Oscar Wilde:

'A religion dies when it is proved true.

Science is the record of dead religions.'

'All concepts of African thought (God, Man, Body, Mind, Space, Time, Society, Ancestor, etc) are concepts by intuition and have aesthetic qualities./ African art is beyond the western horizon on account of its source, its metaphysical assumption and the African mode of knowing. African art is basically the art of integration and of naming. It is an art of vision.'

And, this vision is not sub-divided into sub-sub-disciplines which are then deconstructed to yield meaning, compelled 'to talk about a whole series of manifestations and representations in the case of a single work, which in European eyes has nothing to do with it.' (Griaule, 1950, p23)

A word which features prominently in African thought is:

'Ndu \[an Igbo term\] is a generic term meaning LIFE, that is, LIFE in general: and _Ndubuisi _refers to 'Ndu Mmadu' or to 'Human Life'. Ndu (Life) is not Being because it is an event, a life-force or a dynamic experience.'

This is identical to the Bantu notion of Ntu or 'Life-force';

'From the beginning of the world, there has always existed a ... Life-force, created by one God, Which is always active, spread throughout the universe, dispensed to all animated life-forces, man, animals , and plants... communicated to the things which we...consider inanimate, and extensively granted to a whole phanteon of mystical life-forces bound up with everyday life.' (Griaule, 1950, p53)

It is these very metaphysical, cosmological, ontological, and

aesthetic beliefs, and concepts which furnish the African world-view, and beg for evaluation an honestly empathic consideration of underlying general metaphysical principles.

The work of Leopold Senhor's provides an excerpt of sheer lucidity and sparkling insight illuminates the mindset we wish to share and understand;

'Let us, therefore, consider the attitude of the Negro-African towards the objects to be known, towards the Other; God, man, animal, tree or pebble, natural fact or social fact. Contrary to the classical European, the Negro-African makes no distinction between himself and the object. He does not hold it away from himself to be examined or analyzed; or rather, after having examined it, if not actually analyzed it, he takes it in his hands, alive as it is, careful not to kill it...He touches it, he feels it, he is conscious of it...It is by his subjectivity...That he discovers the Others/...Here we see the Negro-African sympathizing, leaving his ego to identify himself with the Other, dying himself to be born again in the Other. He does not absorb, he is absorbed. He lives a common life with the Other; he lives in symbiosis, he has cognition of the Other...Subject and object are compared dialectically in the very act of cog-nition...'I want you to be conscious of me', says an elector who wants you to know him well. 'I think therefore I am', wrote Descartes. But the remark no longer seems to have validity; one is always thinking, and the 'therefore', a logician's conjunction, is meaningless.

The Negro-African could say: 'I sense the Other; I dance the Other; I am'. Now, to dance is to discover and to recreate, particularly if the dance is a dance of love. Ii is in any case the best mean of knowing. So that cognition is at the same time discovery and creation, or rather recreation, and the recreation is the image of God.'

It should be glaringly obvious the meaning or purpose of this extract, to illuminate and offer insight into the mental 'world' of the Other, 'he lives in symbiosis', 'he is absorbed', with his 'world'.

In essence, the boundaries erected in Western thought between self and Other are absent, moreover, the African sensibility has transcended by 'sense' and 'creation' through art.

  
_Chapter 5_

**Conclusion**

  
The notion of God as the 'Great Creator' or 'Artist' in African thought is connected to the human artist's expressions and styles, it is essentially the persons ability to 'harmonize' their Will in the service of the ' Great Life-Force.

Sound is the 'model of experienced reality in African thought', the oral traditions which have modified and adapted with the cultural 'mummification' of colonial conquest, also preserve and transmit the underlying metaphysical assumptions present in the given society.

'African art is a fusion of quality and relation, of intuition and analysis, whether in music or mask; and it would lose its meaning, purpose and significance if divorced from the process of life.' (The Idea of Art in African Thought, N.Anayanwu)

The dynamism intrinsic to the African world-view pours through every sphere of life to join and unify thought, ethics, practices, politics, ritual, and belief through a social medium, being art.

It has been a continual aim to show how dominant Eurocentric scholarly inquiry has hindered an advanced understanding of Other cultures, in this instance African notions of Ontology and Aesthetics. The use of art in the West to propagate grudgingly malicious stereotypes of perceived 'Other's, are repugnant and reprehensible. It is the outmoded fields of inquiry and methods within aesthetics which perpetuates the generation of derogatory images/stereotypes ;

'In its popular version, transmitted through schools, churches, music-halls, cheap newspapers, and comics and other cheap literature produced for children, racism told the British working class that black people were savages whom British rule was rescuing from heathenism and internecine strife.' (P.Fryer, Aspects of Black British History, p31)

It is in opposition, although not adversarial, that many of the contemporary academics referred to have embarked on enlightening journeys to re-discover, or simply discover 'ontic' _truths_ which assist greater levels of cultural understanding.

The works of Husserl and Heidegger, respectively, certainly have provided much needed stimulus for contemporary philosophy and philosophic critique. Husserl represents, perhaps the first in a tradition of German philosophers who questioned the assumptions and accepted practices of an established philosophical order, hence phenomenology.

If this is the case, then Heidegger is the pioneer of Western metaphysics whom lured the Wittgensteinien 'fly from the bottle' of philosophy. It is as a result of his enduring thought and work that we have the opportunity to partake in his ideas on; the 'Ontological Significance of Art', and his acute observations on the state of Western philosophy.

The work continued by Sartre illustrates the progressive urge amongst modern thinkers to re-evaluate, revise, and redefine that which reveals incomplete or inadequate scholarly enterprise.

'The image as the site of a special power that must either be contained or exploited; the image, in short, as idol or fetish \[though it must be noted that these terms implicitly carry pejorative connotations within Western thought\].' (Image and Ideology)

It was the purpose of the paper on Burke and Kant to draw out the significance of image as a threat, or to be 'contained', as we shall see;

'It is not enough, then, for Burke and Lessing to count on Natural laws which govern the power of the symbols to keep images in their place; these laws \[a universal aesthetic\] must be continually enforced \[via culture?\] by generic prescriptions that will keep the arts, and the sensory aesthetic modes, in their proper places.'

(Image and Ideology)

It is the overt, scientifically 'justified', version of _truth _which one cannot separate from the burning resentment and racism of a large amount of the philosophy of aesthetics, Burke and Kant reveal these opinions unassumingly, and it the purpose of their inclusion to acknowledge with hindsight their philosophic failings.

  
Yet, in the closing passages of this thesis I want to draw attention to the similarities between African modes of thought as illustrated, and that of Pre-Socratic Europe, the relationship being outlined is one of persistent cultural borrowings and transmission. Isokrates, early 4th B.C, Athenian orator mentions the 'reputation' of the Egyptian political model being 'preferred above all other'(Bousiris, 18, p113)

He later states that Pythagoras became a 'student of religion' in Egypt, claims similar to these are also credibly made about: Thales, Plato, and Aristotle. Now the credence in these views is not categorically relevant, it is that people believed it to be so, Herodotus the notable ancient historian has also contributed to the speculation on the subject.

'They (the Greeks) affirm in words that Okeanos, beginning from the sun's risings, flows round the whole earth, but they give no effective demonstration of this.' (Herodotus, Histories iv, 8)

The conception of the world held and espoused by the champions of Greek society, the poets, is the notion of Okeanos, and provides much intriguing material.

'For the possibility must be considered then that this particular conception

originated in the great river civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Babylonia,, and was somehow introduced in Hellenistic form.' (The Pre-Socratic Philosophers)

When we view mythology as a forerunner to philosophical cosmogony then we might also notice that the genesis and the seeds of many of the myths, beliefs, rituals, deity's , and even philosophies are indebted to pre-classical non-western sources.

In effect, the circling river was presupposed in the myth that the sun, after crossing the sky with his horses and chariots, sails in a golden bowl round the stream of Okeanos and so arrives back in the east before dawn. As adequately elucidated in, 'The Pre-Socratic Philosophers', this myth is uncannily similar to that of Babylonian and Egyptian cosmology and creative myth which may lead one to infer that perhaps they share more than this basis of cosmological belief. Rather, that the cultural transmission and borrowing between these areas pre-empts the notable poets and stretches further throughout the genesis Greek philosophy.

'...Egyptians have not only been accepted by the present inhabitants but have aroused no little admiration among the Greeks/..it was nevertheless eagerly visited by Opheus and the poet Homer in the earliest times and in later times by many others, such as Pythagoras of Samos and Solon the lawgiver.' (Diodorus Siculus, Book I. 68)

The usefulness of this, in addition to an excerpt from the British Museum Library:

'That we should surely appreciate Near Eastern **culture for their own sake** as well as their contribution to Greek culture.' (Rosalind Thomas, University of London) \[Bold and underline mine\]

Serves the aim of attributing value, recognition of cultural ties, an enhancement of cultural understanding, plus the possibility of_**a philosophical tradition encompassing, all that is philosophy.**_

A divergence in philosophic method has widened with respect to many developing nations in terms of industry and modernity, their philosophies 'have strictly the same destiny' , despite partaking in 'distinctly different histories'. The aim of seeking meaning pervades humanity, and it is specifically in the history of ancient thought that a meeting point may be identified in the ideals between what is are conveniently termed, the 'natural sciences' and 'traditional religion'. The work that novelist and essayist, Chinua Achebe completed in the 1950s is in my view, comparable in purpose and consequence to the work of the early Greek philosophers in exploring the 'metaphysical landscape' of their emerging nation \[Achebe was writing before and during Nigerian independence\].

It is my contention that a rise in a Western educated African literary class allowed and prompted the resurgence, interest, and pursuit of searching for an African philosophy, deserving of its people. The use of Pre-Socratic works follows the basic European premise that ancient Greece represents a romanticized period in European history, the time t which an autonomous independent nation rose above all others to dominate culturally and ideologically, for millennia. It has been a constant theme throughout that the conceptual distance between Pre-Socratic and African philosophy are negligible, despite the fact that the widening gulf between the modern and developing worlds may well threaten the social, ontological, and ideological roots of society.

The specific proposition is that writing and more especially the alphabetic literacy made it possible to 'scrutinize' discourse in a way that had been previously unable. By giving oral communication a semi-permanent form; this scrutiny favoured the increase in scope of critical activity, and hence of rationality, skepticism, and the logic to resurrect memories of those questionable, social, political, or religious dichotomies. This increased scope assisted the development of one type of thought, but has consequently hindered and suffocated another, i.e. as Achebe foresaw, Thing Fall Apart.

We must realize that by navigating a middle path between the personalized 'sympathetic affinities' of African 'magic', or the impersonal mechanistic reductionist 'magic' of modern science:

'the symbol is always someone's symbol.'

Consequently we must treat it as such....
