  stares blankly at sky  As Sun bled orange yellow rays  Into twilight's

  And showers incandescence  On a gambler's last penny spiralling  On its axis;
  amoral or  Random acts of happiness.  Calculated cruelty  You and me both 
  Bobbing like buoys  Upon the great blue

Tilted arc hood cloak hidden eyes brooding  
Under blue grey skies shiftily scanning  
Dock edge containers hoisted  
Knife's edge mirror's ledge  
Sea stares blankly at sky  
As Sun bled orange yellow rays  
Into twilight's beckoning embrace  
Stolen swiftly ahead  
Of Lunar' pale gaze and relentless chase  
From dusk to dawn scouring the surface  
Of the Earth for a spot to rest  
And claim its own;  
Run, run ever faster, Light leaks  
Into the future  
And showers incandescence  
On a gambler's last penny spiralling  
On its axis; amoral or  
Random acts of happiness.  
Calculated cruelty  
You and me both  
Bobbing like buoys  
Upon the great blue
