  An apparition who wasn't so much "money", as the expectation of "money". That
  light fluttering feeling preceding possession and the 'spending power' that
  money confers. Where imagination runs riot in several directions at once and
  the world opens out and flattens like a cardboard box; begging the question,
  'what's next, here I am?'.  This creature positively dared you to make
  contact, to reach out through speech, touch, taste and upon sight robbed
  vision of thirst. Quenched the human pursuit of perfection in succulent
  flesh.  A smile in collusion with the laws of physics; gravity, solar storms,
  the big bang and string/particle theory ganged up to rebut rebuke doubt. Awe
  shone like a shimmering star through the folds of deep space, radiating
  through a haze of perishable matter. Inexplicable and unending. A spectacle
  alluding to the divine posed philosophical questions and suggested the
  impossibility of a satisfactory answer.  Eyes of clarity, crystal water, kind;
  under the aspect of of the moon. Keepsake secrets contained like swirling milk
  beneath the sheen of pearl.  A voice without words fills the ears like liquid
  and thumps and resounds and travels down to the chest drowns the lungs and
  weakens legs. Thought becomes flesh in the mind's eye, idea transforms and
  ebbs into electric current taking ghostly form. Ideas escape by extension
  through pen and stain paper. Eyes swallow them greedily.
