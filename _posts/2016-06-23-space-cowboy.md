[Space Cowboy][0]

Then skillet synthetic prose with skully clung to my dome; Roamed round Rome in the shadows cast at noon when history looms heavy. Above overcast, portal to the incorporeal transported in a millennium Ibis.

To Memphis -- left this worldly shell to inhabit spiritual bliss on the banks of the bluest Nile. Where crocodiles smiled at the invention of Nubian minds and Baboons whooped and screeched - Worshipful at the Master's feet Like Socrates of Greece.

Factually speaking, we're all moving under an arched vault conversing with Deacons.

Discuss didactic dialectics if you want; Dogon done discovered that - way back... People ebony-stone black whose feet burned brightly, with hair white and woolly like sheep's coats...

Quote Thrice greatest -- Monument of ages, Mountain among sages...Even Confucius based his wisdom on ancient...Codice or hieroglyph arriving like ships among ideas traded on expedition trips or trade skirmishes.
