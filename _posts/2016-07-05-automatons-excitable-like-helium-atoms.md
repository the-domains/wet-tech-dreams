Automatons excitable like helium atoms

Agency is usurped in relay

In which, politicians form teams

In order to pass the baton

It's too deep to fathom

Why we've relinquished liberty

In exchange for the toppling of Saddam

Only to rouse an ancient Kraken

Like some prophesy read in the ring of Saturn

It unfurls like Hegel's pattern

**The** turns to **anti** & **syn** gives birth

To Adam

And Eve - like when autumn hastens the falling of the leaves.
