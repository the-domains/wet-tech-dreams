  Immaculate Isis rests perfectly still etched from the rock of the immutable.
  Statuesque, bedecked in gold bled from the seams of the earth's soul to shine
  resplendent. Centrepiece of a courtyard of cold black-speckled granite,
  beneath a pitch-black starry sky.  Forgotten heroes, gods and men draped in
  the thick and heavy robes of...Stories, battles and deeds lost and won. Long
  since scattered across the seven seas, five continents and four corners of the
  globe.  Which adult animal remembers its birth, yet, instinctively
  acknowledges its mother?  The Great lake encircled by the Sun's chariot; the
  blazing battle between light and dark everyday. Fought and won, nought and
  one, fought and won, nought and one.  Our virgin; nought begets one from void;
  seed of creation in the dark womb of imagination. Take root and give life to
  thought and give thought to life amid arid plains, sun baked sands, blood red
  clay and life to land. Creation myths delivered after the birth of man.  Moses
  revealed God's Will and contrived law on Mt.Sinai; man made myth and magi made
  magic and in turn magician. Upon whose branch Solomon grew and bore the
  everlasting fruits of wisdom; which spilt into the cup of Queen Makeda; the
  hand the rocked civilisation.  Osiris arose, shining black prince of the
  hidden, standing guard at the gate of the Kingdom. From whence Demeter our
  oracle sprung forth from the waters of the Nile; which fed, bathed,
  supplicated and supplied. Arkenaton built and reigned from the heavens to the
  Underworld as the architect of Genius. Regal figure of Nefetiti, cuts eye with
  warrior's dreadful silhouette, limbs like lances, eyes beam like beetle backs
  under merciless sun.  Hermes Trimegistus, galacticus of Daemons, word sound
  and power: whose seal remains remains unbroken beneath the paw of the sphinx.
  Dwelling within his palm like a flame to a lantern - Logos lead the way, to
  impermanence and eternal flux. Hericlitus ordained it as such, as children we
  clutch through struck by the rod of the father - War and Suffering.  Stolen
  star of the South: shining forth at court, crushing might, as Tsar's right
  hand. Prodigious progeny, Pushkin the proud off-spring and forefather of a
  literary nation. In cold contrast and harmonious continuum stands Baldwin.
  Smearing words which soothe like succulent aloes.  Lion-headed Leopold led a
  Nation from the flames of colonial rule and soared, roared, sang, danced,
  initiated, liberated and celebrated the Ancestor's spirits'; upon the
  ascendent hopes of his people. And still we rise, through rhythmic soul
  trains, quatrains, Coltrane's rain; freeing a tortured temptress of desire as
  sacrifice to elevate our consciousness, ever higher - Towards A Love Supreme.
  Past the plateau's of a Mood Indigo and frantic wheels of sound. A Mandala
  spinning. 1960s, Brown vs. Brown and we keep on sinning, though she walked
  through the valley, en transit past New York and Paris - Nina, a sensitive
  soul...Mighty Mandela, exemplar, elected Majestic bold keeper of tradition
  clothed in humanity, humility and dignity...Bodhisvatta of an age...passes the
  torch
