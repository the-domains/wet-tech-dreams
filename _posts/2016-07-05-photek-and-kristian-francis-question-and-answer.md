Photek & Kristian Francis Question & Answer

"TECHNICALLY SPEAKING"

**K** - Where have you been for the last two years? I understand that you're living out of the UK at the moment.

**P** - Yeah, L.A!

**K** - What's the reason for the hiatus and absence on the circuit for the last couple of years?

**P** - Well I've been living out in L.A and I'm doing some film music and continuing what I'm doing and I just haven't played out since middle of last year. Apart from a couple of things in L.A, That's where I've been: just making music, doing some other stuff, making some hip-hop and doing my thing.

**K** - Is there a difference in the perception of dance music and what you do in L.A? Because it begs the question, is it a better working environment for you? Is it more conducive to your creative process?

**P** - I think that a change of scenery is all that I need to give me more inspiration. That could be living in Australia, it could be anything...Musically it almost doesn't matter where you are, the change of scenery is always good, you get a new bit of vitality from that. Just from going from place to place.

**K** - Do you change your approach when working across the genres? Do you approach it all as _music_?

**P** - Yeah you do! For guitar music, for house music, for hip-hop; If you're into what you're doing then you can do it well. Its how you get that music to people, the outlet and the way it comes out, which can be where the problems come.

If I start putting out rock music on my label!

**K** - Yeah!

**P** - People aren't going to like that but that doesn't mean I'm not allowed to do that. It doesn't mean I'm not allowed to make different types of music.

**K** - No, of course not. In terms of the new material and as you said, your reintroduction to the scene; "Look here I am, I've been away"

**P** - Yeah, I feel that's in order!

**K** - What underlies the new work, conceptually, the artists you're working with, the themes etc...

**P** - For Virgin my dilemma has been what type of record am I going to make. I've made all these tracks of different styles and how am I going to put it together for an album. I take my time, and most people know on the albums, to get it right to my ear. So the launch is for the two drum'n'bass singles coming out \[at the time of the interview\] on Photek records. So they're pure, two drum'n'bass singles. Pure drum'n'bass with no confusion. As far as the album is concerned, yeah, there'll be an album on Photek records but that will be a pure drum'n'bass album.

**K** - I understand what your saying to be, despite the fact that when your making music it's coming out as music, when you put it out it's important to maintain the integrity of your drum'n'bass releases.

**P** - You've got to have some kind of coherent view of your output, you can make all this stuff, but you do have to divide it up a bit. Most people if they put in a CD, they are in a certain mood to hear a certain thing. You don't want to hear conflicting sounding music, if I want to hear r'n'b and the first track's r'n'b and the next track's drum'n'bass I'm going to be pissed off. Your going to be changing CDs the whole time, the attraction of mixed CDs is you get an hour of what you wanted.

Generally in releasing records you've got to think a little bit like that, my Virgin albums have been varied and across the board kind of records, but I still think you have to have some kind of parameters there.

**K** - You have gained a mighty reputation regarding your technical abilities as a producer,

And the way your describing your approach to your music it seems that you're obviously not scared of crossing boundaries. Do you have a secret, a philosophy that determines how you produce your sounds, because it's very unique and there's still a hunger for what you're doing.

**P** - That's a nice thing. It's touching to come back and play to a hardcore drum'n'bass crowd and they still want to know what I'm doing. Which you can do, if you do it with the right attitude, you can do all kinds of stuff - people will allow you that without turning their backs on you as long as you do it in a credible way. If you believe in what you're doing people can feel that; so that was nice to play for the crowd and get the amazing reception that I did, and we all did. It's great to come back and people haven't forgotten or lost interest.

Philosophy wise: if you feel what your making then generally other people will too, and for me never try to make records for other people, that you think in your heart of hearts shouldn't sound like that. Because then if you don't even like it 100% then how can you expect anyone else to.

That's my most important thing, just do what you think sounds good, because then some other people are likely to agree with you, whereas in the beginning if you don't even like it, and your just trying to hit a market I just don't think you can make music like that without a huge budget behind you to force feed people, and it's not what I'm into.

That's one, the other is try and do something a little bit new each time, use a different combination of sounds, bring a different atmosphere to it, try not to repeat formula's.

**K** - Any advice to budding producers and DJs?

The scene is really flourishing and there's more music coming out from independents. What would you say to someone's who just starting out, or perhaps is inspired by your music and who's been following the scene for some time?

**P** - Tough one! First of all, before you give up your job keep an eye on what the music business is doing, because maybe if they keep giving away music on the Internet none of us will be able to do this profession anymore. Maybe in ten years nobody will buy any music anymore, and then you'll be making music for you and your mates, so bear that in mind.

Other than that, you've got to be passionate about what your doing - And when you hear yourselves talking about making music for certain markets and stuff like that...Then just give up and do us all a favour!

Just make music because you would spend your last five pounds on that 12" and walk home because you can't afford a bus - all your music's got to be like that, never make anything average, because there's so much music out there and so much crap that suffocates the good music.

Only do it if: you'd die for it and those people are severely needed - _If you feel like you're one of those then jump on board!_

**K** - What about your views on the growth and scope of the music?

There are quite a lot of people in the UK looking towards S.America, N.America, Canada, New Zealand, Eastern Europe and other territories and the growth of the drum'n'bass virus.

**P** - Unless you work extremely hard touring the whole world and dominating every market then you're not going to be able to hold onto that. Of course you've got people like Marky and those guys in Brazil and they've got a thing going there, and in America you've got AK 120, Dieselboy and all these guys - they've got a massive following of their own. If you check some of the foreign Internet sites you'll see that they're talking about English producers are slipping and they need to learn how to do it US style! It's a joke, but they don't think so, and they're the one's buying the records.

Yeah it's all opening up but don't take anything for granted because the hierarchy or the honours tree over here will get washed away in a second in other countries because they haven't grown up with it and they don't give a damn. Some of the kids weren't old enough to remember when Fabio and Grooverider started so what do they care!

So it's exciting but it doesn't mean that any of us are involved, maybe we started something rolling but it could be out of our hands.

**K** - Following the virus analogy:

**P** - It will mutate and become a different germ.

**K** - ...with a different host.

**P** - For me the music was coming from hip-hop people and reggae people meeting techno people. It was a _mixed _crowd racially but there was a very strong black theme in the music mixed with this new age techno sound. In America maybe you won't hear any of that, it's just going to be Slipknot with some extremely fast beats, so it's mutating into all kinds of hideous things that you might not have expected or wanted. In different countries people are putting in different stuff. The "originators", it's out of their hands now, so if you feel strongly about what the music _should_ be like then you're going to have to work extremely hard to convince everybody that your way is the right way.

**K** - Isn't what you're talking about a healthy progression, or a shift of power?

P - It depends on your point of view, because I think some of it is unhealthy because I have a certain view of what drum'n'bass is. Maybe I'm the only one in the world who thinks that.

**K** - regarding your own musical reference points have you always been into hip-hop or is this a new development?

**P** - It's my first music. Electro and then hip-hop I think I've seen it since it's conception, maybe not first hand in the Bronx but...I've certainly been fed it on a drip growing up since the age of 11\. The whole rave scene was a distraction from that for me, I used to laugh at all this acid house music and next thing I was going out to all these raves. The result of people like me is breakbeats in rave music.
