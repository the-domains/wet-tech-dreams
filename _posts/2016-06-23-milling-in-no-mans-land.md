Milling  
In lobbies, sauntering down padded corridors.Expressing Disinterest with every glance.Spatio-temporal Bubbles of waiting,Spiked with anticipation.Suspended animation Becomes lifestyle-and-statement,Travelling inna 21st century fashion.  
Cool blue tones bouncing offa glass and chrome sentient structures, pressure pads, integrated audio architecture, infra-red sensors, x-ray, voice recognition/speech pattern coding...  
Design  
Like a futurist Zen greenhouse.
